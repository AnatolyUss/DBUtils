Create a new DBUtils release:
=============================

* Check the documentation.

* Run all tests in DBUtils/Testing.

* Update and check the Release Notes.

* Set version number and release date with setversion.py.

* Build html pages using buildhtml.py.

* Create a tag in the SVN repository.

* Create a source tarball with::

    python setup.py sdist

  You will find the tarball in the "dist" folder.

  Under Windows, this will be a .zip file, otherwise a .tar.gz file.
  You can force .tar.gz under Windows with --formats=gztar,
  but you need to use Cygwin or have a tar binary installed.
  Generally, it is better to create the release under Unix to avoid
  problems with DOS linefeeds and missing file permission.

* Upload to the Python Package Index (PyPI, aka "cheese shop"):

  In your (Unix/Cygwin) home directory, create a .pypirc file as follows::

    echo "[server-login]
    username:myusername
    password:mypassword" > .pypirc

* Register the project with::

    python setup.py register

* Upload the source package with::

    python setup.py sdist upload

  You have to install setuptools to make this work.
  Alternatively, you can simply upload using the web interface.
