# DBUtils

DBUtils is a suite of tools providing solid, persistent and pooled connections to a database that can be used in all kinds of multi-threaded environments like Webware for Python or other web application servers. The suite supports DB-API 2 compliant database interfaces and the classic PyGreSQL interface.

The current version of DBUtils requires Python 2.6 or newer (Python 3 is supported).
